<summary>Video: 1 - Introduction to AWS</summary>
<br />

AWS stands for 'Amazon Web Services'. There are many services, but you don't have to know all of them. We are going to use 
- Compute: EC2 (virtual servers in the cloud)
- Storage
- Networking & Content Delivery: VPC (e.g. firewalls)
- Security, Identity & Compliance: IAM
- Containers

### AWS Account and Services Scope

The *global* scope (AWS account, IAM users, Billing, Route53) is divided into *regions* (S3, VPC, DynamoDB), which themselves are divided into *availability zones* (physical datacenters running the virtual machines: e.g. EC2, EBS, RDS).

All AWS services are created in one oth these 3 scopes.

<summary>Video: 3 - IAM - Manage Users, Roles and Permissions</summary>
<br />

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. The IAM service lets you manage who has access to your services. You define users or user groups and assign them certain permissions.

When you create an AWS account you have a root user by default with unlimited privileges. So we first should create an admin user with only those privileges needed to create an EC2 instance, deploy applications on it, etc. 

We need an admin user who has privileges to create other users and roles, also system users (like jenkins). Groups can be used to manage the permissions of several users who all have the same permissions.\
If you want to give a service permissions to do something, you cannot directly assign privileges to a service. You have to create a role, assign the privileges to that role, and then assign the role to the service. Each service must have its own role though. You cannot assign the same role to multiple services.

### Creating an Admin User
Open the "Services" dialog (link on the top left), click the filter "All services" and select "Security, Identity & Compliance" > "IAM" > "Access Management" > "Users". Press the "Add users" button and enter a name (e.g. 'admin'). Check the optional "Provide user access to the AWS Management Console" checkbox. Select the radio buttons "I want to create an IAM user" and "Autogenerated password". Check "Users must create a new password at next sign-in" as recommended. Press the "Next" button.

Choose "Attach policies directly" and select the "AdministratorAccess" policy. Press the "Next" button. On the summary page press "Create user". Copy the console sign-in URL, the username and password and save it in your password manager. You may also download a .csv file containing the credentials.

With these credentials the admin user has access to the web console. To provide him also programmatic access from a command line, you need to generate an access key ID and a secret access key. But first log out as root user and login again as the new admin user. Open the console sign-in URL (the account ID should be filled out automatically, otherwise you'll find it in the information you got when creating the AWS account) and enter username and password. On first login you'll have to change the password. Do it and don't forget to update the password in the password manager.

#### Generate an Access key
Go to the users list, click on the new admin user, select the "Security credentials" tab, scroll down to "Access keys" and press the "Create access key" button. Select "Command line interface (CLI)" and check the "I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key" checkbox. Press "Next". You may enter a description. Press "Create access key". Copy access key and secret access key, store them in your password manager and download the .csv file. Press "Done".
