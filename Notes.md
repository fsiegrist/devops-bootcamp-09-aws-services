<br />

AWS stands for 'Amazon Web Services'. There are many services, but you don't have to know all of them. We are going to use 
- Compute: EC2 (virtual servers in the cloud)
- Storage
- Networking & Content Delivery: VPC (e.g. firewalls)
- Security, Identity & Compliance: IAM
- Containers

### AWS Account and Services Scope

The *global* scope (AWS account, IAM users, Billing, Route53) is divided into *regions* (S3, VPC, DynamoDB), which themselves are divided into *availability zones* (physical datacenters running the virtual machines: e.g. EC2, EBS, RDS).

All AWS services are created in one oth these 3 scopes.
